# DevOpsDays Core Team Membership Policies

## Expectations of Core Team Members

**Active Core Organizers** commit to one or more of the following:
- Onboarding and guiding new events via emails and kickoff calls
- Answering emailed questions from local events and the public; sending other guidance emails
- Maintaining the website (including vetting/merging PRs from local events)
- Active Core Organizers are eligible for election as a Co-Chair
- Active Core Organizers are eligible to vote on new team members, co-chairs, and policy change approvals

**Advisory Core Organizers** are members of the organizers-core@devopsdays.org mailing list, but their main task is to weigh in when there are areas of discussion. Advisory Core Organizers are eligible to vote on new team members, co-chairs, and policy change approvals.

**Emeritus Core Organizers** are not members of any of the core mailing lists and are listed as emeritus on the website. They are not expected to weigh in on anything.

Every year on 1 November (to coincide with the new tenure of a co-chair) the co-chairs will send an email to all Active and Advisory Core Organizers asking them to confirm if they intend to remain in their current position (active or advisory). Team members will have until 30 November to reply; any lack of reply will be assumed as a change to Emeritus. 

## Adding New Core Team Members

To be added to the devopsdays Core team, a prospective member must be nominated by an existing member (Active, Advisory, and Emeritus Core Organizers are all eligible to provide nominations). Proposals should be submitted to the co-chairs via email. The co-chairs will send an email to the Active and Advisory Core Organizers (via organizers-core@devopsdays.org) asking for their vote/feedback. There will be a 2 week voting period after this first email is sent; any abstention will count as a positive vote for the proposed member. In order to be added, a proposed member must carry a ⅔ majority vote of current active and advisory members. 

A temporary private Slack channel will be created for use of discussion of the proposed member (example name: **#vetting-lee-smith**, etc). All Active and Advisory Core Organizers will be added to this channel. Responsibility of creating/deletion of this channel falls to the co-chairs. 

After voting has concluded on the proposed member, this temporary channel will be deleted.

If a member has a strong objection to the inclusion of a proposed member, they should make this objection known in the temporary vetting channel in Slack. If the objection is sensitive, the objection may be raised privately to the co-chairs. 

## Co-Chair Policy

There will be two co-chairs of the DevOpsDays Core team at any time. Chairs will serve a tenure of two years, in a one-year staggered tenure schedule. Tenure begins on 1 November of a calendar year and terminates on 31 October two years following. For example:

*Navita - tenure begins 1 Nov 2020, ends 31 Oct 2022<br>
Lee - tenure begins 1 Nov 2021, ends 31 Oct 2023<br>
Chris - tenure begins 1 Nov 2022, ends 31 Oct 2024<br>
Etc*

(exception is for the first co-chairs of the new schedule, Matt Stratton and Yvo van Doorn. In order to accommodate the staggering, Matt will serve a 3 year tenure.)

Note: all dates for deadlines, tenure time, etc, are in UTC.

Tenure schedule:

| Name          | Tenure Start | Tenure End  |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Matt Stratton | 1 Nov 2020   | 31 Oct 2023 |
| Yvo van Doorn | 1 Nov 2020   | 31 Oct 2022 |
| TBD           | 1 Nov 2020   | 31 Oct 2024 |

### Choosing co-chairs

Proposals for replacement co-chair should begin 1 August of the year in which a chair’s tenure expires, 12 weeks prior to the 31 October end of a chair’s tenure.

In order to be considered as a proposed co-chair, candidates must have been an Active Core Organizer (as defined in the “Expectations of Core Members policy) of DevOpsDays Core for a minimum of 6 months. Co-chairs cannot serve two consecutive terms, but may run for co-chair after a minimum of one year hiatus.

Candidates must be nominated by an active or advisory core team member. It is permitted for candidates to self-nominate. Proposals will be sent to the existing co-chairs, who will contact the nominated parties to confirm they are interested and willing to take on the role. 

Proposals will close on 1 September, 8 weeks prior to the exiting chair’s tenure ending on 31 October. The month of September will be used to vote/obtain approvals on the nominated party. Voting/comments close on 30 September.

Active and Advisory Core Organizers are eligible to vote. Voting will be done via secret ballot. The specific method of voting (platform, etc) will be updated in this policy document no later than 1 June 2022.

Chairs will tally votes and make the decision on the new chair member, which will be announced to the core team no later than 10 October. The new chair will take on their new duties starting 1 November.

In the instance that no candidates are available, or no candidate receives sufficient votes, the existing co-chairs will consult with active and advisory Core members to determine next steps.

### Co-chair partial terms and opt-out

In the event that a co-chair needs to step down from their position before the scheduled end of their term, a special co-chair election will take place, following the usual process for co-chair election. There will be a two-week nomination period, followed by a two-week voting period. 

## Removal or suspension of core members or co-chairs

In the instance that a core team member or co-chair requires removal, the following process should be taken. The party proposing the removal or suspension of the member must propose this to the organizers-core@devopsdays.org email list. If the proposing party is unable to do this (due to personal connection to an incident, etc), they will need to ask another core team member or co-chair to submit the removal/suspension proposal on their behalf. 

Voting on removal or suspension requires a quorum of 50% of the current number of Active and Advisory Core Organizers (minus the party in question) to vote, and a ⅔ majority of votes in favor of removal/suspension to carry. 

Decision on whether to remove, or suspend participation for a time period, will be determined prior to the voting via discussion on a case-by-case basis, but the vote will be specific to the proposal.
